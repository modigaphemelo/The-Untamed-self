                        <p>An original thought isn't necessarily brilliant. It's <strong>authentic</strong>. It comes from your actual experience, not from a factory.</p>
                        <p>How to craft one:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Start with a sensation, not an idea (What does your body feel?)</li>
                            <li>Describe it in your own words, not borrowed terminology</li>
                            <li>Check: Is this true for me, or just something I've heard?</li>
                            <li>Be willing for it to be messy, incomplete, contradictory</li>
                            <li>Notice if it expands or contracts your sense of possibility</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Your first original thoughts might feel small. "I actually prefer rainy days." "That popular food tastes bad to me." "I don't enjoy that activity everyone loves." These are seeds of mental sovereignty.</p>

                        <p>- Internalizing that your worth equals productivity<br>
                        - Believing your body should look a certain way<br>
                        - Accepting that certain lives are more valuable than others<br>

                        <p>Your scattered mind isn't personal failure. It's industrial outcome. You're not lacking discipline. You're competing with billion-dollar systems designed to hijack your consciousness.</p>

                        <p>Instead of trying to "think positive" (another factory product), practice mental diversity:</p>
                        <p>- Let some thoughts grow wild<br>
                        - Compost toxic thoughts into fertilizer<br>
                        - Cultivate thoughts that bear fruit for your actual life<br>
                        - Create ecosystems where contradictory thoughts can coexist<br>
                        - Notice which thoughts attract life and which create deserts</p>
                        <p>Your mind isn't a factory to optimize. It's an ecosystem to tend.</p>

                        <strong>Fanon's decolonial wisdom:</strong> "The first revolution is in your own mind.

Each thought you trace back to its factory, each 'should' you refuse, each authentic sensation you honor—this is the guerrilla warfare of liberation."
