                    <p>We live in a culture that worships the mind and treats the body like a problematic pet. The mind is for thinking, creating, achieving. The body is for carrying the mind around, looking acceptable, and not causing trouble.</p>

                        <p>Descartes' "I think, therefore I am" built the modern world. It also built our cages. If you are your thoughts, then your body is just machinery. Feelings are glitches. Sensations are noise. Intuition is superstition.</p>
                        <p>The problem: <span class="accent">Your body isn't just housing your mind. It <em>is</em> your mind.</span> Your gut has 100 million neurons. Your heart has its own nervous system. Your entire body thinks, remembers, and knows things your prefrontal cortex can't access.</p>
