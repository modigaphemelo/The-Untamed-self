                    <p>For years, I followed the instructions. I built a life that looked correct from the outside:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="bullet-list">
                        <li>The right habits — waking early, meditation, exercise</li>
                        <li>The right thoughts — positive, productive, ambitious</li>
                        <li>The right relationships — strategic, boundaried, growth-oriented</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>The result was not freedom. It was a well-decorated cage.</p>
                    
                    <p>The bars were not installed by someone else. <strong>I put them there myself.</strong> I was the architect, the builder, and the prisoner. And I called it discipline. I called it success.</p>

                    <p>Then the fractures began to show:</p>

                        <h4><i class="fas fa-calendar-times"></i> The Missed Routine</h4>
                        <p>One morning, I simply did not do it. No meditation, no journal, no plan. Instead of guilt, I felt something sharper: <span class="accent">a stolen hour of my own life</span>.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h4><i class="fas fa-fist-raised"></i> The Useful Anger</h4>
                        <p>I was told anger was toxic. Then I felt real anger about something that mattered — and it gave me the force to change it. It was not poison. It was <span class="accent">fuel</span>.</p>
                    </div>

                        <p>An afternoon watching clouds. Dancing in the kitchen without reason. These things do not optimise your life. They <span class="accent">remind you why you are alive</span>.</p>

                            <p>You do not break out of prison with one explosion. You file through one bar at a time. Skip a routine. Say what you actually think. Trust a feeling. These small acts accumulate.</p>
