                    <p>We live in a culture that worships persistence. "Never give up!" "Quitters never win!" "Push through the pain!" These slogans sound empowering until you realize: <strong>Most of what we're persisting at isn't worth persisting at</strong>.</p>

                        <p>You've invested 3 years in a degree you hate? "Finish what you started!"<br>
                        5 years in a relationship that makes you smaller? "You've come so far!"<br>
                        10 years in a career that drains you? "Don't waste your experience!"</p>
                        <p>The sunk cost fallacy isn't just a cognitive error. It's <span class="accent">cultural programming</span>. We're trained to confuse endurance with virtue, even when we're enduring something that's killing us slowly.</p>

                        <li>The artist forcing work they no longer believe in "because it sells" (while their creativity dies)</li>

                        <strong>Nietzsche's strategic wisdom:</strong> "Persistence is only virtue when applied to worthy ends.

                    <p>Walking away isn't binary. It's a spectrum. These thresholds help you know where you are:</p>
                    
                    <div class="method-grid">
                        <div class="method-card">

                            <h3>The Energy Drain</h3>
                            <p><strong>Symptom:</strong> This thing takes more energy than it gives. You're constantly depleted after engaging with it.</p>
                            <p><strong>Question:</strong> Is this temporary (like learning a new skill) or permanent (like a toxic dynamic)?</p>
                            <p><strong>Action:</strong> If permanent > Reduce investment. Create distance. Test life with less of it.</p>

                            <p><strong>Symptom:</strong> This requires you to compromise core values regularly. You feel like you're betraying yourself.</p>
                            <p><strong>Question:</strong> Can the thing change? Can you change your relationship to it?</p>
                            <p><strong>Action:</strong> If no > Begin exit strategy. Start building alternatives.</p>

                            <p><strong>Symptom:</strong> You've stopped growing. You're repeating patterns. There's no challenge, only maintenance.</p>
                            <p><strong>Question:</strong> Is stagnation the nature of this thing, or can you reintroduce growth?</p>
                            <p><strong>Action:</strong> If inherent > Consider this thing complete. Thank it. Release it.</p>

                            <p><strong>Symptom:</strong> Your body reacts with tension, illness, or aversion when you engage with this.</p>
                            <p><strong>Question:</strong> Is this a fear response to growth, or a wisdom response to harm?</p>

                            <li>What's the worst that could happen if I leave? (Is that likely or fear?)</li>
                            <li>Who would I be without this? (Does that scare or excite me?)</li>

                        <strong>Signs it's worth staying:</strong><br>
                        - Aligns with core values<br>
