                    <p>Look at what's happened to joy in our time:</p>
                    
                    <div class="example-box bg-earth">
                        <h4><i class="fas fa-chart-line"></i> Productive Joy</h4>
                        <p>"Exercise joy" → must improve fitness<br>
                        "Reading joy" → must increase knowledge<br>
                        "Social joy" → must build network<br>
                        "Creative joy" → must produce sellable art<br>
                        "Rest joy" → must increase tomorrow's productivity</p>
                        <p>Even our pleasure has become <strong>instrumental</strong>. It must serve a higher purpose: health, success, growth, optimization.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="example-box bg-earth">

                        <p>Retail therapy. Wellness purchases. Experience economy. Subscription happiness.</p>
                        <p>Joy becomes something you <strong>acquire</strong> rather than something you <strong>experience</strong>. It moves from internal state to external commodity. And like all commodities, it's never quite enough, always needing the next purchase.</p>
                    </div>

                        <li>Justifying it ("It's good for my mental health")</li>

                        <li>Earning it ("I deserve this because I worked hard")</li>
                    </ul>

                        <strong>Foucault's analysis of pleasure:</strong> "Even your enjoyment has been disciplined. Productive pleasure. Efficient happiness. Optimized relaxation. You've internalized the demand that everything—even your joy—must serve the machine. Useless joy is therefore revolutionary: pleasure that exists purely for itself defies the logic of utility that governs modern life."

                        - Useless joy can't be sold to you<br>
                        - Useless joy doesn't make you a better worker<br>
                        - Useless joy might even make you question why you're working so much<br>
                        - Useless joy reminds you that you're more than a producer/consumer</p>
                        <p>Systems that profit from your productivity have a vested interest in making you feel guilty for "unproductive" pleasure.</p>
