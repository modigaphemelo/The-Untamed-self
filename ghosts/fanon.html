                        <p>Fanon's first book (1952) explores the psychological effects of colonialism: How the colonized internalize the colonizer's view of them as inferior. How they wear "white masks"—adopting the colonizer's language, culture, values to escape their own blackness.</p>
                        <p><strong>Applied to personal cages:</strong> How many of us wear "successful masks," "productive masks," "normal masks" to escape our authentic selves? How many of our "good habits" are attempts to wear the mask of the "ideal person" as defined by systems?</p>
                        <p>The mask isn't just deception. It's <strong>survival strategy</strong>. But survival at what cost?</p>

                    <p>Fanon's insight: <strong>Oppression creates psychological distortions in both oppressor and oppressed</strong>. The colonizer sees the colonized as less than human. The colonized internalizes this view. Both are trapped in the lie.</p>
                    
                    <div class="voice-note">
                        <strong>Fanon's diagnosis of modern cages:</strong> "Your 'self-improvement' is often just wearing better masks. Your 'productivity' is internalizing the colonizer's value system. Your 'discipline' is policing yourself according to their standards. You think you're becoming better. You're becoming better at being colonized."

                            <p><strong>Modern equivalent:</strong> Being reduced to your productivity, your appearance, your usefulness. The corporate gaze. The social media gaze. The self-optimization gaze.</p>
                            <p><strong>The effect:</strong> You start seeing yourself through that gaze. You become your own surveillant.</p>

                            <p><strong>Modern equivalent:</strong> The "violence" of setting boundaries. Of saying no. Of walking away. Of rejecting systems that define your worth.</p>
                            <p><strong>The effect:</strong> This violence isn't destructive. It's <em>deconstructive</em>. It breaks the internal chains.</p>
                            <p><strong>The warning:</strong> Not all violence is equal. Fanon distinguishes revolutionary violence from the violence of oppression.</p>

                        <p>Fanon was a psychiatrist who understood: <strong>Oppression is somatic</strong>. It lives in the body.</p>

                            <li>The tension of constantly wearing a mask</li>

                            <li>The "nervous condition" of living between two worlds—your authentic self and the mask</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Your body keeping the score isn't just personal history. It's <span class="accent">political history written on your flesh</span>.

                        <p><strong>Fanon would diagnose:</strong> "These aren't just habits. They're <em>internalized discipline</em>. You've colonized yourself. You police your own behavior according to standards that serve systems, not your aliveness."</p>
                        <p><strong>From <em>A Dying Colonialism</em>:</strong> "The colonial world is a Manichaean world." (Divided into good/bad, civilized/savage, productive/lazy)</p>
                        <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Your productivity culture is Manichaean: productive vs. lazy, disciplined vs. undisciplined, successful vs. failing. You've internalized these divisions. Your "good habits" are often you playing colonizer to your own colonized self.</p>

                        <p><strong>From his psychiatric work:</strong> Fanon used dance, sports, physical therapy to help patients reconnect with their bodily schema.</p>
                        <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Your gut feelings, your tension patterns, your fatigue—these are your bodily schema trying to communicate beneath the historical-productivity schema. Trusting your gut isn't mystical. It's <em>decolonizing your perception</em>.</p>

                        <p><strong>The lesson:</strong> He wrote not for career, not for fame, but because the truth demanded expression. He wrote as a dying man to the living. Every word urgent. Every insight forged in the fire of mortality.</p>
