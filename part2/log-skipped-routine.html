                    <h2><i class="fas fa-handcuffs"></i> The Architecture of a "Good" Prison</h2>
                    
                    <p>For 1,147 consecutive days, I had meditated. Twenty minutes every morning. No exceptions. Travel, illness, grief—the streak continued. I was proud of this. I called it <em>discipline</em>. I called it <em>commitment</em>. I called it <em>self-mastery</em>.</p>
                    
                    <p>The ritual was precise:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="bullet-list">
                        <li>5:15 AM: Alarm. No snooze.</li>
                        <li>5:20: Glass of water. Stretch.</li>
                        <li>5:25: Cushion arranged. Timer set.</li>
                        <li>5:30: App opens. Breath begins.</li>
                        <li>5:50: Bell chimes. Streak recorded. Day "won."</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>This was not mindfulness. This was <strong>performance</strong>. Performance for an audience of one: the "ideal self" I was supposed to be becoming. The self who would be enlightened, calm, productive, optimized. The self who had mastered himself.</p>
                    
                    <div class="voice-note">
                        <strong>Foucault's ghost observes:</strong> "You were not meditating. You were participating in your own surveillance. The app tracked your compliance. You tracked your streak. The panopticon was in your pocket, and you called it peace."
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>The cage was beautifully decorated:</p>

                        <p>Friends praised my discipline. Colleagues asked for tips. Social media showed others with longer streaks. We were all building our cages together, comparing bar designs, offering each other better locks.</p>

                    <p>It wasn't dramatic. There was no crisis, no rebellion planned. The alarm chimed at 5:15 as usual. I swung my legs out of bed. Poured the water. Stretched. Arranged the cushion.</p>
                    
                    <p>And then I didn't sit.</p>
                    
                    <p>I stood there, looking at the empty cushion. The app timer waited. 20:00 glowing in soft white. The streak counter: 1,147 days.</p>
                    
                    <p>Something in my body <em>refused</em>. Not my mind—my mind was already composing the excuses: "You're tired. Just do ten minutes. Don't break the streak." My body, though. My body remembered something my mind had forgotten.</p>

                        <p>"The body keeps the score of every compromise. It remembers what the mind has been trained to forget: when you stopped belonging to yourself."</p>

                    <p>The app chimed at 5:30. A gentle, encouraging sound. I didn't move.</p>
                    
                    <p>At 5:35, the app chimed again—a reminder. "Your meditation awaits."</p>
                    
                    <p>I reached for my phone. Not to meditate. To turn it off. The screen showed the streak. 1,147 days. I tapped "Skip Today."</p>
                    
                    <p>A warning appeared: <em>"Breaking your streak resets your progress. Are you sure?"</em></p>

                        The vegetables: Sometimes one, sometimes the other.<br>
