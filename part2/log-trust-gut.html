                    <p>I was raised to worship at the altar of rationality. Feelings were unreliable. Intuition was superstition. "Gut feelings" were what uneducated people had instead of data. My education was a decades-long training in distrusting anything that couldn't be measured, modeled, or monetized.</p>
                    
                    <div class="example-box bg-earth">
                        <h4><i class="fas fa-brain"></i> The Triumph of the Prefrontal Cortex</h4>
                        <p>I mastered decision matrices, cost-benefit analyses, SWOT charts, probabilistic thinking. I could argue any position with logic. I could dismantle any emotional objection with data. I had turned myself into a beautifully efficient reasoning machine.</p>
                        <p>The problem: <span class="accent">Machines don't have survival instincts</span>. They don't get that chill up the spine when something is wrong. They don't feel the visceral "no" when all the numbers say "yes."</p>

                    <p>The evidence of my rationality was impeccable:</p>

                    <p>I was the master of my fate because I never left anything to chance. Or feeling. Or that unreliable, unscientific thing called "instinct."</p>

                            <p>When mind and gut conflict:<br>
                            1. What does the gut know that the mind doesn't?<br>
                            2. What subtle data might the body be processing?<br>
                            3. What's the cost of ignoring this feeling?<br>
                            4. Can I test the gut's hypothesis safely?</p>

                        <p>I no longer choose between gut and mind. I use both:</p>

                            <li><strong>Gut</strong> says: "This feels wrong" → <strong>Mind</strong> investigates: "What specifically feels wrong?"</li>
                            <li><strong>Mind</strong> says: "This looks perfect" → <strong>Gut</strong> checks: "How does my body respond?"</li>
                            <li>When they agree: Proceed with confidence</li>
                            <li>When they disagree: Pause. Investigate. The disagreement itself is data.</li>

                        - A "funny feeling"? A hesitation? A chill?<br>
